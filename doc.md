## User Flows

### Seller / Buyer role-specific discovery flow
1. **Login** (`/login`) — Single-click Google Sign-in popup or Email Magic Link passwordless authorization.
2. **Role select** (`/role-select`) — writes `role: 'seller' | 'buyer'` to `users/{uid}`.
3. **Onboarding** (`/onboarding`) — sets profile `name`, `about`, and collects the **Mobile Number** (for shared book linkages). For sellers, also collects default pricing (saved using `setPrice`) and optionally current coordinates (providing coordinates is **mandatory** only if `openToSell` is enabled).
4. **Nearby sellers** (`/buyer/nearby` or `/seller/nearby`) — geolocation-based seller discovery. The searching user **must** provide their current coordinates (natively or via Noida/Delhi test mode fallback) to query and display matching sellers in the 10km radius.

### MilkBook Shared Ledger flow
1. **Starting a MilkBook** — Any onboarded user (buyer or seller) can create a MilkBook. The creator inputs the partner's name, phone (optional), default quantities, and prices.
2. **Automatic Phone Linking** — If the partner's phone exists (or is registered later), the book is automatically shared with them in read-only mode.
3. **Daily Entries** — The creator logs morning/evening milk quantities in the book's detail view.
4. **Billing & Payments** — The creator records payments; billing totals and balances due calculate automatically.
5. **Viewer access** — The partner logs in and sees the book under "Shared Books" on their dashboard, viewing all calendars, summaries, and receipts in view-only mode.

## Service Layer

All Firestore access goes through `src/services/`. Never call Firestore directly from components.

| Service | Key exports |
|---|---|
| `milkbook.service.js` | `getMilkBooks`, `getMilkBook`, `addMilkBook`, `updateMilkBook`, `deleteMilkBook`, `getMilkBookRecords`, `saveMilkBookRecord`, `deleteMilkBookRecord`, `getMilkBookPayments`, `addMilkBookPayment`, `deleteMilkBookPayment`, `linkPendingMilkbooks`, `backfillMilkBookRecords` |
| `seller.service.js` | `getSellerProfile`, `updateSellerProfile` |
| `buyer.service.js` | `getBuyerProfile` |
| `billing.service.js` | `calcBillSummary(records, prices, payments)` |
| `location.service.js` | `saveUserLocation`, `getNearbySellers` (optimized using Geohash ranges with client-side role filtering) |

---

## Auto-Record System

Client-side auto-recording runs via dashboard hooks for active milkbooks created by the current user when opening the app.

---

## Billing Calculation

`billing.service.js → calcBillSummary(records, prices, payments)`:

```
totalLitres = sum of records[cattleType].total for the month
totalAmount = sum of (totalLitres × prices[cattleType]) (rounded to 2dp)
totalPaid   = sum of payment.amount for the month
remaining   = totalAmount - totalPaid
```

---

## Cattle Types

Defined in `src/utils/constants.js`:

| Value | English | Hindi |
|---|---|---|
| `cow` | Cow | गाय |
| `buffalo` | Buffalo | भैंस |
| `goat` | Goat | बकरी |
| `camel` | Camel | ऊंट |

## Firestore Security Rules Summary

- `users`, `sellers` — any auth user can **read** (needed for nearby-seller discovery and phone match); only owner writes.
- `milkbooks` — creator has full CRUD; partner has read-only. Unauthenticated or unlinked users cannot view.
- `milkbooks/{id}/records`, `milkbooks/{id}/payments` — creator has write/delete; both creator and partner have read access.
- `linkRequests` — buyer creates; seller reads/updates.
